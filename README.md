## If you have the time to only look one of my repos : [Archery Scorer](https://github.com/Natouche68/archery-scorer)

This is a simple web app that helps you to count points in archery. The app automatically calculate the totals.

I made it using Svelte and Vite and is available as a PWA at [https://archery-scorer.vercel.app](https://archery-scorer.vercel.app).
