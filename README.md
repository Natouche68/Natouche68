## If you have the time to only look one of my repos : [Theme Generator](https://github.com/Natouche68/theme-generator)

This little web app was originally made for a pixel art competition between me and my brother, but you can for sure use it for a small game jam. There are 30 different themes, and the app just pick a random one.

It's a very simple Svelte app *(not SvelteKit)*. You can make a pull request to add themes, if you have any ideas.
